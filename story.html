    "I was a lazy student, and I had no idea why I chose mechanical engineering; in fact, I still had no idea. When I seriously considered my career, I began researching job opportunities in the mechanical field and the roles of a mechanical engineer. Unfortunately, I came to the sad realization that I wasn't interested in any of these jobs. So, I decided to switch my career to finance and started preparing for the KMAT to secure a seat for an MBA.

    However, fate had other plans for me. During my last semester, I met with an accident and was unable to take my final exams. I ended up losing a year, and my entire MBA plan fell apart. In a strange way, it turned out to be a blessing because I had plenty of time to research courses and jobs that were expected to thrive in the near future.
    
    That's when I discovered Python, DevOps, AI, Machine Learning, web development, and so many other technical terms. I was initially overwhelmed and believed it would be impossible for me to master these fields. Then, I learned that some of my friends, despite having numerous backlogs, secured jobs with excellent packages in tech companies.
    
    I reached out to them and asked, 'How did you manage to get placed despite having so many backlogs?' One of them replied, 'To land a good-paying job in the tech field, you don't need certificates. All you need are skills and the ability to learn on your own.'
    
    Inspired by this, I started self-learning programming languages and gained an understanding of how web applications work, including front-end and back-end development. I realized that I had a passion for coding, and within just four months, I began applying for tech jobs.
    
    During this time, I met one of my relatives, who had a typical perspective. When I told him about my plan to switch from mechanical engineering to the tech field, he cautioned, 'Don't make that switch. The technology field is highly volatile, and you could lose your job at the peak of your career.'
    
    His words left me thoroughly confused. He also advised me to prepare for a government job through the Public Service Commission (PSC) exams. So, I decided to abandon my tech plans and started studying for the PSC exams.
    
    However, a few months later, I encountered one of my seniors who was five years ahead of me. Seeing him struggle to find a job, I decided to drop my PSC plans. I contemplated enrolling in a design course to land a job in my core mechanical field. Yet, after just a month, I realized that mechanical engineering wasn't my passion. Continuing in that field would only lead to misery.
    
    At that moment, I decided to make the leap into the IT field, but I knew I needed guidance and a network of like-minded individuals. That's when I joined Brocamp. From my experience at Brocamp, I learned that if you're willing to give your all and remain consistent in your journey, you're unstoppable.
    
    Now, after seven months, I'm confident that I'll secure a position at a reputable company with a lucrative package."
